========== Description ===============

YoutubeGen is a script for uploading an album to invidiual youtube videos. It does not matter what format the song audio files are in, and the visual portion of the video is made into the cover art.

The videos will be named '%artist - %title' based on the ID3 tags of the MP3 file, but if they fail to exist, the filename will be used. If you specify -P (or always_playlist=yes in [Settings] under ~/.youtubegenrc), a playlist will be generated. The name of the playlist will be inferred from the first '%artist - %album' found, otherwise it will prompt you.

========== Requirements ===============

This script is made specifically for linux systems, and may work on macs, but not windows.

First, there are a number of package dependencies. Trying to run the script will tell you what they are if they're missing, but if you are using ubuntu run:

   $ sudo apt-get install sox libsox-fmt-all dvd-slideshow python-pymad python-id3 python-gdata

The videos produced are automatically uploaded to your youtube account. In order to do this, you must first get a YouTube developer key (it's free). To do this, go to:

   http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/dashboard/gwt/index.html

========== Uploading an Album ===============

Suppose you have an album like this:

   $ ls
   01 - army song.mp3       06 - voice of youth.mp3  11 - banner of hope.mp3      
   02 - juvenile.mp3        07 - burn 'em down.mp3   12 - law of the jungle.mp3   
   03 - so slow.mp3         08 - urban rebel.mp3     13 - the prisoner.mp3
   04 - vicious circle.mp3  09 - jailhouse rock.mp3  14 - christianne.mp3
   05 - attack.mp3          10 - sonic omen.mp3      15 - black leather girl.mp3
   cover.jpg

To upload the whole album, run the program like this:

   $ youtubegen cover.jpg *.mp3

You will be prompted for the necessary login information, developer key, and a description for
the videos. You can being prompted by specifying the using command line flags, or in your
~/.youtubegenrc. See ``example.youtubegenrc''.
