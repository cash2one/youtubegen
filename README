========== Description ===============

YoutubeGen is a script for uploading an album to invidiual youtube videos. It does not matter what format the song audio files are in, and the visual portion of the video is made into the cover art.

The videos will be named '%artist - %title' based on the ID3 tags of the MP3 file, but if they fail to exist, the filename will be used. The videos are uploaded in the reverse order specified by the track numbers in the ID3 tags, so when you go to the recent uploads on your video manager you can select them and add them to a playlist, and they will be added to the playlist in order.

You can use the '-X' to create higher quality videos, but it is slower to generate the videos and they take longer to upload. Really, the only difference is the cover art is less pixelated.

========== Requirements ===============

This script is made specifically for linux systems, and may work on macs, but not windows.

First, there are a number of package dependencies. Trying to run the script will tell you what they are if they're missing, but if you are using ubuntu run:

   $ sudo apt-get install sox libsox-fmt-all dvd-slideshow python-pymad python-id3 python-gdata

The videos produced are automatically uploaded to your youtube account. In order to do this, you must first get a YouTube developer key (it's free). To do this, go to:

   http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/dashboard/gwt/index.htmlshel

Make it a shell variable as follows:

   $ echo 'export Y_DEV_KEY="<YOUR_KEY>"' >> ~/.bashrc
   $ source ~/.bashrc

========== Uploading an Album ===============

Suppose you have an album like this:

   $ ls
   01 - army song.mp3       06 - voice of youth.mp3  11 - banner of hope.mp3      
   02 - juvenile.mp3        07 - burn 'em down.mp3   12 - law of the jungle.mp3   
   03 - so slow.mp3         08 - urban rebel.mp3     13 - the prisoner.mp3
   04 - vicious circle.mp3  09 - jailhouse rock.mp3  14 - christianne.mp3
   05 - attack.mp3          10 - sonic omen.mp3      15 - black leather girl.mp3

To upload the whole album, run the program like this:

   $ youtubegen.py $Y_DEV_KEY cover.jpg *.mp3

If will prompt you for your login information, and the description to use for all the videos.
